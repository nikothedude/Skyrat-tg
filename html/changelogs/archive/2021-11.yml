      in hand to shake it all around, increasing its fizziness.

      bit, around the level of a toolbox. This also has a chance of bursting the soda
      can on impact, leaving it useless as a weapon after.

      while keeping them shifty and creepy.
  - spellcheck: corrected the name of the peripherals control board being secured
      on the Savannah-Ivanov
  - balance: Radiation is now a status effect, where you are either irradiated or
      not. When irradiated, you will take constant toxin damage, and irregular burn
      damage. Radiation is removed once all toxin damage is healed. Standing under
      a shower will pause the harmful effects of radiation, making it easier to heal.
      Everything that is irradiated will glow green.
  - balance: A lot of radiation sources keep their radiating capabilities, though
      most of it was eyeballed. If anything was significantly nerfed/buffed, feel

      toxin damage when the target is irradiated.
  - balance: Screwdriver, Potassium Iodide, and Pentetic Acid will halt the damaging
      effects of radiation, just like showers. This means no tox damage or burns.
  - balance: The gravity generator, instead of giving radiation when on, will now
      have a high gravity field around it.
  - balance: Radiation protection has been kept to engineering hardsuits, rad suits,
      and H.E.C.K. suits. This can be expanded to others, those are just the ones
      I recognized.
  - balance: Genetics no longer uses radiation, but instead genetic damage. Genetic
      damage works very similarly--once it tops 100%, you will start to take toxin
      damage. Gorillas are now made through genetic damage instead of radiation.

  - rscdel: Removed the emag effect on geiger counters, though an emag functionality
